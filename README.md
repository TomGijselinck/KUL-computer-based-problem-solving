# KUL-computer-based-problem-solving
Course about the methodology for solving technical problems with the aid of the computer. [Master of Engineering, Computer Science]

## ECTS fiche
This course initiates the student into the methodology for solving technical problems with the aid of the computer. This includes important solution techniques such as optimalization or graph algorithms, and also the methodology of translating a technical problem to such an existing solution technique (the set up of the mathematical model) and the interpretation and analysis of the obtained results. Upon succesful completion of the course, the student is able to

- transcribe a given problem formulation in words into a mathematical optimization problem, with correct formulation of decision variables, constraints and goal function;
- characterize the nature of the optimization problem as a linear problem (LP), an integer problem (IP), a non-linear problem (NLP) or a problem of mixed type;
- identify the appropriate solution algorithms and interpret their associated computational complexities;
- formulate optimization problems in the LINGO model generation language, solve the problems with the LINGO software and interpret the numerical results by means of the generated sensitivity reports;
- execute manually some important graph and network algorithms (Dijkstra, Kruskal, Prim, Augmenting path) for simple network problems.
